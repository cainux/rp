# Technical Exercise

## Prerequisites
1. .NET Core SDK 3.0 (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)

## Getting Up and Running
1. `cd` into `src/RP.WebApi/`
2. Run the command `dotnet run`

The project is setup to listen on http://localhost:5000

Once up and running just open your browser to http://localhost:5000 and you'll be greeted with the Swagger UI where you can test the API directly from within the browser.
